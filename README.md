# Breast Cancer Survival Notebook
This notebook is a demonstration of how to perform a survival prediction of breast cancer patients using Kaggle's Breast Cancer Survival Dataset.

## Context
Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer death in women worldwide. Early detection and proper treatment are key to improving the chances of survival. In this context, it is important to understand what are the factors that can influence the survival of patients.

## Dataset
The Kaggle dataset contains clinical and demographic data on 334 breast cancer patients. Each row represents a patient, and each column represents a variable.
The dataset used in this analysis was taken from Kaggle, an online data science platform that offers public and private datasets, as well as tools for data analysis and modeling. The specific dataset used in this project can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/code/micaeld/breast-cancer-survival-pycaret.
## Prerequisites

To run this notebook you will need:

- Python 3.x
- Python packages: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, autoviz, sklearn, imblearn and pycaret

## How to use

1. Clone this repository on your computer.
2. Open the `Breast Cancer Survival.ipynb` notebook in a Python development environment such as Jupyter Notebook or Google Collaboratory.
3. Run the notebook cells in order, following the analysis and generated graphs.

## Results
The model trained on this notebook will be able to predict whether or not a breast cancer patient has survived based on available clinical information. This model could be useful to help clinicians identify patients at higher risk of not surviving and provide appropriate treatment sooner.
